REVISED ALGORITHM 

Check to see if a dvd can move with current velocity 
if it can, 
  if it is going to ocllide with a wall. change the velocity and do not move it
  if not, 
    move it immediatetly 

if not, 
  collide it with the other dvd by changing its velocity and the other dvd's velocity 
  (if the other dvd has not been updated it will move in it's new direction assuming no collissions. This is fine)

need to figure out how to handle wall collissions... (update that first probably)

it does not matter if a piece will move. If it has not already, that is where it's being processed. 

they are collidign into one abother because the handleOCollissions is checking the future position not the current.
